v1.2 (2016-XX-XX)
==================

- Added support for providing inputs to all initializations, methods,
  and functions as Quantities with units and for providing outputs as
  astropy Quantities. See pull request #258 and the documentation for
  full details.

- Internally use astropy.coordinates transformations to transform
  between (ra,dec) and (l,b). Can be tuned using the astropy-coords
  configuration parameter.

- Added TwoPowerTriaxialPotential, a set of triaxial potentials with
  iso-density contours that are arbitrary, similar, coaxial ellipsoids
  whose 'radial' density is a (different) power-law at small and large
  radii: 1/m^alpha/(1+m)^beta-alpha (the triaxial generalization of
  TwoPowerSphericalPotential, with flattening in the density rather
  than in the potential, see Merritt & Fridman 1996, Binney & Tremaine
  2008). These include triaxial Hernquist and NFW potentials. Includes
  fast C implementations that allow efficient orbit integration in
  these potentials (<~5 ms / orbit).

- Added SCFPotential, a class that implements general
  density/potential pairs through the basis expansion approach to
  solving the Poisson equation of Hernquist & Ostriker (1992).  Also
  implemented functions to compute the coefficients for a given
  density function.

- Implemented galpy.actionAngle.actionAngleIsochroneApprox (Bovy 2014)
  for the general case of a time-independent potential, allowing
  action-angle coordinates to be computed for triaxial
  potentials. Previously, this module only supported axisymmetric
  potentials.

- Support for flipping the velocities of an orbit in-place (useful for
  backwards integration).

- quasiisothermaldf input ro replaced by refr to avoid clash with ro
  that specifies units (see above).

- Re-defined the amplitude parameters of a few potentials to allow for
  easier setups with amplitudes provided as Quantities with
  units. This is the case for FlattenedPowerPotential,
  PowerSphericalPotential, and PowerSphericalPotentialwCutoff,
  CosmphiDiskPotential, LopsidedDiskPotential, and
  EllipticalDiskPotential.

- Added a module for modeling the effect of a subhalo impact on a
  tidal stream (galpy.df.streamgapdf); see Sanders, Bovy, & Erkal
  (2016). Also includes the fast methods for computing the density
  along the stream and the stream track for a perturbed stream from
  Bovy, Erkal, & Sanders (2016).

- Added functions to galpy.df.streamdf to compute the length of the
  stream, the density along the stream quickly (in various
  coordinates, including custom sky coordinates), to compute the
  probability p(freq_parallel,angle_parallel), and to estimate the
  number of encounters with DM subhalos.

- Properly intercept CTRL-C (SIGINT) signals during orbit integration
  in C, allowing long orbit integrations to be interrupted without
  killing an entire Python session.

- Added PseudoIsothermalPotential, a standard pseudo-isothermal-sphere
  potential.

- Added the spherical radius as an Orbit method.

- Added the spherical-radial force as a Potential method (rforce) and
  function (evaluaterforces).

- Added KuzminDiskPotential, a potential represented by a razor thin
  disk

v1.1 (2015-06-30)
==================

- Added Python 3 support: in particular, Python 3.3 and 3.4 are now
  supported; earlier 3.* may also work, but haven't been
  tested. Python 2 and 3 are supported using a single common codebase.

- Added SnapshotRZPotential and InterpSnapshotRZPotential potential
  classes: these can be used to get a frozen snapshot of the potential
  of an N-body simulation into galpy. SnapshotRZPotential directly
  calculates the potential and forces using direct summation;
  InterpSnapshotRZPotential builds an interpolation table (it's a
  subclass of interpRZPotential and can be used in the same way). This
  code was mainly written by Rok Roskar.

- Added KuzminKutuzovStaeckelPotential, a Staeckel potential that can
  be used to approximate the potential of a disk galaxy (see Batsleer
  & Dejonghe 1994).

- Added MN3ExponentialDiskPotential that gives the approximation to a
  radially-exponential disk potential as three Miyamoto-Nagai disks
  from Smith et al. (2015; arXiv:1502.00627v1)

- Added PlummerPotential, a standard Plummer potential.

- Add support for converting potential parameters to NEMO format and
  units: nemo_accname and nemo_accpars (both instance and general
  Potential method).

- Added nemo/ directory for C++ implementations of additional NEMO
  potentials (not included in the NEMO release); add PowSphwCut.cc for
  PowerSphericalPotential2Cutoff and Makefile to compile and install
  it. This allows gyrfalcON simulations with MWPotential2014.

- Allow user to directly specify the integration step size to use in
  orbit integration.

- Better implementations of vcirc, eipfreq, and verticalfreq for lists
  of potentials that allows for negative amplitude components.

- Improvements to streamdf: add progIsTrack keyword to specify that
  the progenitor= keyword actually specifies the desired starting
  phase-space point of the track; the phase-space point of the
  progenitor is calculated. Refactored streamdf setup to make this
  easy to implement.

- Orbit fitting can now be performed in custom sky coordinates
  (requires one to specify customsky=True and to implement and pass
  the functions (a) lb_to_customsky= and (b) pmllpmbb_to_customsky=,
  similar to lb_to_radec and pmllpmbb_to_pmradec). For example, this
  allows one to do an orbit fit in the GD-1 frame of Koposov et
  al. (2010).

- Orbit.time now returns the times at which an Orbit is integrated if
  called without arguments.

- Slightly improved implementation of actionAngleStaeckel.py (more
  robust umin/umax finding).

v1.0 (2014-12-10)
==================

- Added MWPotential2014: a Milky-Way-like potential fit to a bunch of
  relevant data on the Milky Way; supersedes MWPotential, which is
  still included; changed many examples to use this new potential;

- Changed default integrator to symplec4_c;

- Changed default vo and ro to 220 km/s and 8 kpc, respectively;

- Allow Orbit initialization to specify a distance and velocity scale
  that is then used to output distances, velocities, energies,
  actions, etc. in physical coordinates;

- Added an orbit-fitting routine (Orbit.fit).

- Added virial radius of NFW potential, allow initialization of NFW
  potential with concentration and mass;

- Added potential.mass to return the mass enclosed for individual
  potential instances; both spherical and axisymmetric potentials are
  covered.

- Sped up many of the functions in galpy.util.bovy_coords by removing
  scipy.frompyfunc dependency;

- Added galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_gevcc,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.force_in_10m13kms2,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_criticaldens,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_meanmatterdens.

- Much improved test coverage.

- Added planarPotential.LinShuReductionFactor to calculate the
  reduction factor for the response of a kinematically warm population
  to a spiral perturbation.

- Added non-axisymmetric DFs to the top-level and the documentation.

- New streamdf track calculation (see arXiv_v2/published version of
  Bovy 2014); better handdling of coordinate-transformation
  parameters in streamdf.

- Installation now prints informative message about whether or not the
  C extensions were installed.

- More informative warning messages when C functions are not used.

- Fix issues with non-square grids in the C implementation of
  interpRZPotential.

- Added Orbit.flip to generate new Orbit instances with flipped
  velocities.

- Improved actionAngle frequencies for circular orbits.

- Removed actionAngleFlat and actionAnglePower, because they are
  superseded.

- Added hasC_dxdv member to Potential instances to indicate whether or
  not they can be used with integrate_dxdv

- Add C implementation of PowerSphericalPotentialwCutoff;

- Moved MovingObjectPotential, BurkertPotential, and interpRZPotential
  to top level; better implementation of interpRZPotential;

- Better handling of vo,ro, and solarmotion in Orbit instances (Orbit
  initialization value is now used to generate RA, Dec, etc. outputs);

- Added --no-openmp installation option to allow installation without
  OpenMP support (workaround for clang not supporting OpenMP; not
  necessary anymore);
