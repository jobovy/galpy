v1.1 (XXXX-XX-XX)
==================

Current development version, last updated 12/26/2014:

- Added Python 3 support: in particular, Python 3.3 and 3.4 are now
  supported; earlier 3.* may also work, but haven't been
  tested. Python 2 and 3 are supported using a single common codebase.

- Added SnapshotRZPotential and InterpSnapshotRZPotential potential
  classes: these can be used to get a frozen snapshot of the potential
  of an N-body simulation into galpy. SnapshotRZPotential directly
  calculates the potential and forces using direct summation;
  InterpSnapshotRZPotential builds an interpolation table (it's a
  subclass of interpRZPotential and can be used in the same way). This
  code was mainly written by Rok Roskar.

- Added MN3ExponentialDiskPotential that gives the approximation to a
  radially-exponential disk potential as three Miyamoto-Nagai disks
  from Smith et al. (2015; arXiv:1502.00627v1)

- Add support for converting potential parameters to NEMO format and
  units: nemo_accname and nemo_accpars (both instance and general
  Potential method).

- Added nemo/ directory for C++ implementations of additional NEMO
  potentials (not included in the NEMO release); add PowSphwCut.cc for
  PowerSphericalPotential2Cutoff and Makefile to compile and install
  it. This allows gyrfalcON simulations with MWPotential2014.

- Better implementations of vcirc, eipfreq, and verticalfreq for lists
  of potentials that allows for negative amplitude components.

- Improvements to streamdf: add progIsTrack keyword to specify that
  the progenitor= keyword actually specifies the desired starting
  phase-space point of the track; the phase-space point of the
  progenitor is calculated. Refactored streamdf setup to make this
  easy to implement.

- Orbit fitting can now be performed in custom sky coordinates
  (requires one to specify customsky=True and to implement and pass
  the functions (a) lb_to_customsky= and (b) pmllpmbb_to_customsky=,
  similar to lb_to_radec and pmllpmbb_to_pmradec). For example, this
  allows one to do an orbit fit in the GD-1 frame of Koposov et
  al. (2010).

- Orbit.time now returns the times at which an Orbit is integrated if
  called without arguments.

- Slightly improved implementation of actionAngleStaeckel.py (more
  robust umin/umax finding).

v1.0 (2014-12-10)
==================

- Added MWPotential2014: a Milky-Way-like potential fit to a bunch of
  relevant data on the Milky Way; supersedes MWPotential, which is
  still included; changed many examples to use this new potential;

- Changed default integrator to symplec4_c;

- Changed default vo and ro to 220 km/s and 8 kpc, respectively;

- Allow Orbit initialization to specify a distance and velocity scale
  that is then used to output distances, velocities, energies,
  actions, etc. in physical coordinates;

- Added an orbit-fitting routine (Orbit.fit).

- Added virial radius of NFW potential, allow initialization of NFW
  potential with concentration and mass;

- Added potential.mass to return the mass enclosed for individual
  potential instances; both spherical and axisymmetric potentials are
  covered.

- Sped up many of the functions in galpy.util.bovy_coords by removing
  scipy.frompyfunc dependency;

- Added galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_gevcc,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.force_in_10m13kms2,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_criticaldens,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_meanmatterdens.

- Much improved test coverage.

- Added planarPotential.LinShuReductionFactor to calculate the
  reduction factor for the response of a kinematically warm population
  to a spiral perturbation.

- Added non-axisymmetric DFs to the top-level and the documentation.

- New streamdf track calculation (see arXiv_v2/published version of
  Bovy 2014); better handdling of coordinate-transformation
  parameters in streamdf.

- Installation now prints informative message about whether or not the
  C extensions were installed.

- More informative warning messages when C functions are not used.

- Fix issues with non-square grids in the C implementation of
  interpRZPotential.

- Added Orbit.flip to generate new Orbit instances with flipped
  velocities.

- Improved actionAngle frequencies for circular orbits.

- Removed actionAngleFlat and actionAnglePower, because they are
  superseded.

- Added hasC_dxdv member to Potential instances to indicate whether or
  not they can be used with integrate_dxdv

- Add C implementation of PowerSphericalPotentialwCutoff;

- Moved MovingObjectPotential, BurkertPotential, and interpRZPotential
  to top level; better implementation of interpRZPotential;

- Better handling of vo,ro, and solarmotion in Orbit instances (Orbit
  initialization value is now used to generate RA, Dec, etc. outputs);

- Added --no-openmp installation option to allow installation without
  OpenMP support (workaround for clang not supporting OpenMP; not
  necessary anymore);
